# **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**
### Data Science challenge from Kaggle

The "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset on Kaggle is a classic example used to teach and practice machine learning, specifically for **classification tasks**. This project provides a comprehensive hands-on experience, allowing a beginner to develop essential skills in exploring real-world data, manipulating it, and building a predictive model.

Beyond the well-known historical facts of the sinking, the available data reveals that survival was not purely random. By examining the data, we can go past the tragic element of chance and discover hidden patterns that indicate which groups of people had a significantly greater chance of being saved.

### **Development Sequence**
This project follows a standard data science workflow:
1.  **Understanding the Problem**: Defining the objective and analyzing the dataset's context.
2.  **Importing the Data**: Loading the provided datasets for analysis.
3.  **Data Exploration**: Conducting an initial analysis of variables, identifying missing values and correlations.
4.  **Model, Predict, and Solve**: Applying machine learning models to the data to make predictions.
5.  **Results and Performance Analysis**: Evaluating the model's accuracy and preparing a final submission.

### **1. Understanding the Problem**
On April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in a tragic loss of life. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew, 1,502 perished, translating to a **32% survival rate**. The primary cause of the high death toll was the insufficient number of lifeboats for everyone on board.

The key insight for this project is that despite some element of luck, certain groups of people were more likely to survive than others. The data suggests that factors such as being a woman, a child, or a first-class passenger played a significant role in a person's chances of survival.

**The Goal:**
The objective is to **build a model that can accurately predict the "Survived" status** of passengers in a separate test dataset, using the information provided in the training data.
